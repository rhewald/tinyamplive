# Upload TinyAmp to GitHub Repository

Your GitHub repository at https://github.com/rhewald/tinyamplive is currently empty. Here's how to upload all the TinyAmp files with the GitHub integration:

## Option 1: Upload via GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)

1. **Go to your repository**: https://github.com/rhewald/tinyamplive
2. **Click "uploading an existing file"** on the empty repository page
3. **Upload these key files first** (in this order):
   - `README.md` - Main project documentation
   - `package.json` - Project dependencies
   - `LICENSE` - MIT license
   - `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules

4. **Create the GitHub integration folder**:
   - Click "Create new file"
   - Type `.github/workflows/ci.yml` 
   - Copy the content from the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file in Replit
   - Commit this file

5. **Upload remaining GitHub files**:
   - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`
   - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`
   - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/venue_request.md`
   - `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`
   - `.github/pull_request_template.md`

6. **Upload the rest of the project**:
   - All files from the `client/`, `server/`, `shared/` folders
   - Configuration files: `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, etc.
   - Cursor AI files: `.cursorrules`, `cursor.json`, `.vscode/` folder

## Option 2: Download and Upload as ZIP

1. **Download all files from Replit**:
   - In Replit, click the hamburger menu (3 lines)
   - Select "Download as ZIP"
   - Extract the ZIP file on your computer

2. **Upload to GitHub**:
   - Go to your empty repository
   - Drag and drop all extracted files
   - Add commit message: "Initial commit: TinyAmp with full GitHub integration"

## What You'll Get After Upload

Once uploaded, your GitHub repository will have:

✅ **Automated CI/CD Pipeline** - GitHub Actions will run tests and builds
✅ **Professional Issue Templates** - Bug reports, feature requests, venue additions
✅ **Contributing Guidelines** - Instructions for collaborators
✅ **Cursor AI Integration** - Full IDE setup for development
✅ **Complete Documentation** - README, setup guides, architecture docs
✅ **529 Venue Events** - All the event data across SF venues

## Verify the Integration

After uploading, check these GitHub features:

1. **Actions Tab** - CI/CD pipeline should be visible
2. **Issues Tab** - Templates should be available when creating new issues
3. **Repository badges** - CI/CD status badges in README
4. **File structure** - All Cursor AI and GitHub integration files present

## Need Help?

If you run into any issues uploading:
1. Try uploading files in smaller batches
2. Make sure file paths are correct (especially `.github/` folder structure)
3. Commit each batch of files before adding more

Your TinyAmp repository will be fully professional and ready for collaborative development once the upload is complete!
